# RecSys-CollabFiltering
This project explores different ways to build a recommendation system on the Movielens dataset through a collaborative filtering approach. The easiest way to test out the code is to download and run with Google Collab. Rec_Sys_Pytorch.ipynb contains the model with the best results.

This project explores using matrix factorization for collaborative filtering. Matrix factorization is a powerful technique in collaborative filtering for recommendation systems, especially when handling large datasets. It works by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix (e.g., user ratings of movies) into two lower-dimensional matrices: one representing users and the other representing items. These matrices capture latent features (underlying factors) that explain the preferences of users and the characteristics of items (movies). By multiplying these matrices, the system can predict unknown user-item interactions (e.g., predicting how much a user would like an unseen movie). This approach also allows the system to generalize, even for users or items that have limited interaction history.
